Moving Enclaves Specifics Info
=======================

MOVING
Enclaves will attempt to move to another site between 5 ~ 6 AM and PM respectively.
Base chance of them moving to another location is 15%. The chance will increase by 1 ~ 15% when no Enclaves will move.

PLAGUE HEART LOOT AND INFESTATIONS
They will kill the Plague Heart or remove the Infestation occupying the site they will be taking.
Loot from the Plague Heart will be added to their Item Stash. You may purchase the items from them.


Also ignore the fact you gain Influence from them removing an infestation. Just imagine your other community members
helped them or something.
